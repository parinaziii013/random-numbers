# random-numbers

This project shows you random numbers.
You can enter the amount of numbers you want, Where to begin and where to end.

If the distance between two numbers is less than lenght, you recieve an error.

For example if you want 4 numbers and you enter 12 and 16, you recieve the error; because in this way numbers can't be random.

Good Luck My Friend!
